# NumLog : A Numerical Reasoning using ILP
The learning methodology for numerical anaylsis <br>
Author:  Daniel Cyrus

<p>Numlog is a learning system to explain and generate a sort of numerical values. Earlier versions of numlog (e.g. numlog.pl, numlog_v2.pl and numlog_v3.pl) are based on logic approach </p>
<p>To use the lates version and for ILP approaches, please use numlogILP.pl</p>
<p>NumLog aims to generate rules that are both highly accurate and easily understandable, ensuring low complexity for better explainability.</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
1. Copy and paset NumLogILP to your current project directory
2.import NumLog as a module in you Prolog code:
```prolog
:- use_module('NumLogILP').
```
